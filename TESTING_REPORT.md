## Issues Identified and Solutions

### 1. Critical Issue: spaCy/numpy Compatibility

**Problem:**
```
ValueError: numpy.dtype size changed, may indicate binary incompatibility. 
Expected 96 from C header, got 88 from PyObject
```

**Root Cause:**
- Anaconda environment has multiple numpy versions
- spaCy compiled against different numpy version
- Dependency conflicts with existing packages

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Fallback Testing**: Created spaCy-independent tests
2. **Mock Integration**: Unit tests with mocked spaCy functionality  
3. **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions for clean environments

**Recommended Resolution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Clean virtual environment
python -m venv clean_env
source clean_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option 2: Conda environment 
conda create -n legal-anon python=3.9
conda activate legal-anon
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Option 3: Docker deployment
docker build -t legal-anonymizer .
docker run -p 8501:8501 legal-anonymizer
```

### 2. Model Availability Issue

**Problem:**
- `llama3:8b-instruct` model tag not found
- Configuration specifies unavailable model

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated to use `llama3:8b` (available)
- Configuration allows model override
- Graceful fallback in connection testing

**Code Fix:**
```python
# config.py - Allow model override
OLLAMA_CONFIG = {
    "model": os.getenv("OLLAMA_MODEL", "llama3:8b"),  # Fallback to available model
    # ... other settings
}
```

### 3. Dependency Management

**Problem:**
- Complex dependency tree with conflicts
- Different environments have different package versions

**Solution Implemented:**
- Comprehensive dependency checking in test suite
