Responses to your questions:

1. Ollama Setup: Should I assume Ollama is already installed, or include setup scripts? 
It has been installed but a setup script is good to make it portable
2. Document Size Limits: The spec mentions 50MB files but 50k word warnings - should I prioritize file size or word count validation?
This needs to be driven by limitation of using a 8B model with 8K token limit.  We will use chunking etc. but please come up with a proposal based on the limitations I have laid out
3. Legal Database Access: For cross-reference testing, should I simulate with mock data or expect real legal databases?
No databases.  Will upload documents using the UI
4. Authentication: The optional user authentication - should I implement this or skip for MVP?
Skip
5. GPU Support: Should I include GPU acceleration detection for Ollama, or keep it simple?
Simple
